patients are more pronounced under extreme luminance conditions than in the optimal luminance condition and (ii) whether complaints belonging to different extreme luminance conditions are associated.

Median (interquartile range) mean deviation of the visual field of the patients' better eye was -4.5 (-10.7 to -1.9) dB. Questions were addressing visual performance under five luminance conditions: presumed optimal (outdoor on a cloudy day), low, high, sudden decrease and sudden increase. We compared percentages of patients and controls who reported visual complaints while performing activities under different luminance conditions. Percentages of patients and controls with visual complaints were 4 versus 0% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) for optimal luminance and 48 versus 6% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 22 versus 1% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 32 versus 1% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and 25 versus 3% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for low, high, sudden decrease and sudden increase in luminance.

Factors related to erythrocyte aggregation were also determined: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), zeta sedimentation ratio (ZSR), and plasma fibrinogen levels. Erythrocyte deformability was observed at various fluid shear stress levels, with a laser diffraction ektacytometer. Correlations were sought between each of these measures and current or nadir CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, and each measure was compared between three subgroups based on current and nadir CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (severely immunosuppressed, immune reconstituted, never severely immunosuppressed). The following parameters were significantly different between HIV-infected subjects and controls: increased erythrocyte aggregation, at stasis (P < 0.001) and low shear stress (P < 0.001), increased ESR (P < 0.001), increased ZSR (P < 0.028), increased serum fibrinogen (P = 0.015), and decreased erythrocyte deformability (P < 0.001).

Polyubiquitination studies were used to establish the involvement of the proteasome.

Confocal fluorescence microscopy of the mutants showed three distinct subcellular localizations, namely, a plasma membrane pattern, an ER pattern, and a mixed pattern to both compartments. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and N-glycosylation profiling established the predominant ER localization of P33S, G36N, H69Y, M105T, M105V, C181R, C204R, C204Y, and G488D mutants. Coexpression of these mutants with WT FZD4 showed the inability of the mutants to trap WT FZD4. Culturing the expressing cells at reduced temperatures or in the presence of chemical agents directed at ameliorating protein misfolding resulted in partial rescue of trafficking defects observed for M105T and C204Y mutants.

Retinal layer thickness was measured in nonperfused areas (NPA) larger than 2 optic disc areas, areas of sparse capillaries (SC), and perfused areas (PA-DR) in eyes with diabetic retinopathy. Retinal layer thickness was also measured in perfused areas in eyes without diabetic retinopathy (PA-NDR), and the thicknesses were then compared. In addition, swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography images and retinal thickness maps were compared to investigate the distribution of retinal thickness changes and spatial relationships to areas of retinal perfusion. The inner retinal thickness in NPA was significantly thinner than the inner retinal thicknesses in SC, PA-DR, and PA-NDR (all P < .001), and the inner retinal thickness in PA-NDR and SC was significantly thinner than that in PA-DR (P\u00a0= .006 and .031, respectively). In a distribution analysis of the extramacular areas, NPA spatially overlapped with areas of severe retinal thinning in all locations.

The eyeball shape on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was classified according to the dimension of the longest diameter: axial dimension (prolate sphere), group 1; horizontal dimension (horizontally oblate sphere), group 2; and vertical dimension (vertically oblate sphere), group 3. The deviation of the CRVT, as a surrogate of lamina cribrosa (LC) shift, was measured from the center of the Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) demarcated by OCT imaging, with the horizontal midline as 0\u00b0 and the superior location as a positive value. The angular location of the longest EOB was also measured. Positions of CRVT and EOB according to the 3D eyeball shape.

The angular deviation of the CRVT differed among the groups: to the nasal side in group 1, to the temporal side in group 2, and along the vertical meridian in group 3. In cases of asymmetric eyeball shape, the CRVT was deviated toward the undergrown side from the overgrown side, regardless of grouping. The angular location of the longest EOB was in the direction opposite to the CRVT position (P < 0.001). A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that the temporal location of the CRVT was associated with older age (P\u00a0= 0.001), nasal location of the longest EOB (P < 0.001), and oblate shape of the eyeball (P < 0.001, group 2; P\u00a0= 0.007, group 3).

Prospective, interventional case series. Fifty-two consecutive patients with cataract following proton therapy were included. All cataracts were graded using LOCS III. Relationships between proton beam and cataract subtypes, as well as between dose, proportion of lens irradiated, and extent of cataracts, were assessed. Tumor diameter, volume, stage, and equatorial tumor location were associated with extent of posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC) that were diagnosed at a median (interquartile range) 36\u00a0months (22;83) after treatment. In multivariate analysis, the tumor volume (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and an equatorial tumor location (P\u00a0= .01) were risk factors for extensive PSC. Lens irradiation was avoided in 10 patients. In the remaining 42 patients (81%), the extent of PSC significantly correlated with the dose to the lens receiving 10, 26, and 47\u00a0Gy (P\u00a0= .03, P\u00a0= .03, and P\u00a0= .04, respectively), the dose to the lens periphery receiving 10 and 26\u00a0Gy (P\u00a0= .02 and P\u00a0= .02, respectively), and the dose to the ciliary body receiving 10 and 26\u00a0Gy (P\u00a0= .03 and P\u00a0= .02, respectively).

Ten patients underwent -6.00-diopter, 6-mm PRK. The patients were reviewed frequently for 12 months. Corneal haze was measured objectively in two ways: (1) an opacification index was determined from the variance in digitized retroillumination images; and (2) light reflected and scattered back from the cornea was assessed by gray-scale analysis of video slit images. In vivo confocal microscopy recorded the anatomic changes occurring in the cornea, and computer analysis of the images quantified the keratocytes and subepithelial deposit. Visual performance was assessed by Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and glare-induced visual dysfunction. In the first week, epithelial irregularity resulted in a transient reduction in all aspects of visual function. In the first month, keratocyte disturbances reduced contrast sensitivity at high frequencies and produced glare. Over the next couple of months, the subepithelial deposit resulted in a more prolonged loss of contrast sensitivity at low frequencies and glare-induced visual dysfunction due to the scattering of light.

The aim of this study was to characterize the microenvironment of epiretinal PVR tissue, in order to shed more light on the complex pathophysiology and to unravel new treatment options. A total of 44 tissue samples were analyzed in this study, including 19 epiretinal PVRs, 13 epiretinal membranes (ERMs) from patients with macular pucker, as well as 12 internal limiting membranes (ILMs). The cellular and molecular microenvironment was assessed by cell type deconvolution analysis (xCell), RNA sequencing data and single-cell imaging mass cytometry. Candidate drugs for PVR treatment were identified in silico via a transcriptome-based drug-repurposing approach. RNA sequencing of tissue samples demonstrated distinct transcriptional profiles of PVR, ERM, and ILM samples. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 3194 upregulated genes in PVR compared with ILM, including FN1 and SPARC, which contribute to biological processes, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. The xCell and IMC analyses showed that PVR membranes were composed of macrophages, retinal pigment epithelium, and \u03b1-SMA-positive myofibroblasts, the latter predominantly characterized by the co-expression of immune cell signature markers. Finally, 13 drugs were identified as potential therapeutics for PVR, including aminocaproic acid and various topoisomerase-2A inhibitors.

Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were infected with WNV strain NY385-99 at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Virus replication was evaluated by virus titers at different times after infection. The susceptibility of RPE cells to WNV infection was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. IFN-beta expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and by measurements of antiviral activity in cell culture supernatants. IFN signaling was evaluated by phosphorylation of transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1/2) proteins, with immunoblot analysis. RPE cells appeared to be highly sensitive to WNV infection. Maximum viral titers were found 24 hours after infection, followed by a continuous decline during the course of infection. WNV infection of RPE cells was followed by increased IFN-beta expression associated with IFN signaling and subsequent inhibition of WNV replication. In this study, the first cell culture model of ophthalmic WNV infection was developed and characterized in RPE cells, and the molecular mechanisms of WNV infection were studied.

Lens centration, ovalization of the capsular bag and capsulorhexis opening, distance between the anterior optic surface and the anterior capsule and between the posterior optic surface and the posterior capsule, as well as presence of capsular striae were evaluated. The capsular bag was stained with trypan blue, and the ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) was stained with fluorescein to enhance visualization. In each eye, the lens conformed to the capsular bag with precise centration. No ovalization or distortion of the capsular bag or the capsulorhexis and no posterior capsule striae were observed. Measurements of the capsulorhexis diameter before and after IOL implantation were the same.

A retrospective, comparative, consecutive study of 68 patients with macular holes. In total, 34 patients underwent vitrectomy and ILM peeling, and 34 patients underwent vitrectomy and ILM peeling with the assistance of indocyanine green. The main outcome measures were postoperative visual acuity and macular hole status. Indocyanine green increased the ability to visualise and peel the ILM. The average preoperative visual acuity in the group where ICG was used was 6/36 and the group where ICG was not used was 6/60. The average follow-up was 25 weeks for the ICG group and 53 weeks for the group with no ICG. Both groups were also compared at 25 weeks follow-up. Hole closure rate for the group with ICG was 97% compared to 91% without ICG. The mean postoperative visual acuity was 6/24 for the group with ICG and 6/12 for the group without ICG, a difference of two lines on the Snellen chart when compared with the preoperative acuity (P-value 0.299, Student's t-test). Both groups had a mean improvement of Snellen acuity of two lines (ICG group: P-value 0.0002, Student's t-test; no ICG group: P-value 0.00004, Student's t-test). In all, 83% of patients in the ICG group maintained or improved their visual acuity compared to 91% in the group without ICG. There is no doubt that indocyanine green stains and assists in visualisation and therefore increases the ease of peeling the ILM in macular hole surgery. Initially, there was concern regarding a poorer outcome for patients with the use of ICG, which has also been previously discussed in the literature. When the two groups were compared at a similar follow-up time of approximately 25 weeks, it was shown that there was no statistically significant difference between the outcomes in the two groups.

To understand the immunologic factors responsible for rejection in this instance, the authors have created \"high-risk\" eyes in mice by inducing corneal neovascularization. The authors then examined the fate of orthotopic corneal grafts placed in these beds and assessed the development of donor-specific delayed hypersensitivity (DH) in recipient mice. Three interrupted sutures were placed in the central cornea of recipient BALB/c mice to induce corneal neovascularization. Two weeks later, when corneal vessels occupied more than two quadrants of the cornea, mice received orthotopic corneal grafts from donor mice expressing alloantigens encoded by major and minor histocompatibility loci. Corneal allografts were evaluated by slit-lamp examination after grafting, and recipient mice were examined at the time of the rejection to determine whether they had acquired DH to alloantigens expressed on the corneal grafts. Compared to grafts placed in normal eyes, a much higher incidence of rejection was observed among corneal allografts placed in neovascularized eyes (96.7% versus 46.7%). Moreover, grafts in neovascularized beds were rejected much more swiftly (2 weeks versus > 3 to 4 weeks). Rejection of corneal allografts in high-risk eyes coincided temporally with development of intense donor-specific DH, and the specificity of this immune response was directed solely at minor H antigens (not major histocompatibility complex-encoded antigens) on the graft. These results indicate that eyes rendered high risk by virtue of corneal neovascularization fail to provide immune privilege for orthotopic corneal allografts. In this circumstance, the grafts rapidly induce intense donor-specific DH that is readily detectable within 2 weeks of engraftment, at which time the grafts are acutely and universally rejected. The recipient DH response is directed exclusively at minor H antigens on the graft, which is consistent with the view that neovascularization creates graft beds in which recipient antigen-presenting cells infiltrate the graft and carry antigenic information by lymphatics to draining lymph nodes. In this manner, anterior chamber-associated immune deviation is avoided, and potentially allodestructive DH is promoted.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2372, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00f5593d-dc0f-490e-9bea-efedef0c6274": {"__data__": {"id_": "00f5593d-dc0f-490e-9bea-efedef0c6274", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Role of RhoA/MERK1/ERK1/2/iNOS signaling in ocular ischemic syndrome.", "year": "2016", "doi": "10.1007/s00417-016-3456-1", "journal": "Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Du R", "Wang JL", "Wang YL"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddf4fe27-00f3-4ebb-bf63-40129507c315", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Role of RhoA/MERK1/ERK1/2/iNOS signaling in ocular ischemic syndrome.", "year": "2016", "doi": "10.1007/s00417-016-3456-1", "journal": "Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Du R", "Wang JL", "Wang YL"]}, "hash": "85174486e105591adc790bdf9beee7d3474784fe75d9d6391ea1f55f6b91d779", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "75cc11d5-cf58-45db-9174-83e2de66984e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Fate of orthotopic corneal allografts in eyes that cannot support anterior chamber-associated immune deviation induction.", "year": "1995", "doi": null, "journal": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "authors": ["Sano Y", "Ksander BR", "Streilein JW"]}, "hash": "cf52ca76d9ca2d5456925c900a77876ba06189422f0a5f888cb5d61cda2a32be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e5a239e-6080-4cea-9772-2a28d4aa8ce5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2520efa2cb938c30d7747718f46be24adc6c04ca4882cf525cf226af6918c355", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). This study uses a rat model to evaluate the role of the RhoA/MEK1/ ERK1/2/iNOS pathways in response to OIS-associated oxidative and nitrosative stress, with a long-term goal of identifying therapeutic targets for OIS. Rats were randomly allocated to one of three groups: bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery (BOCCA), sham surgery control, or unoperated control (n\u2009=\u20098/group). Three months after the procedure, retinas were analyzed anatomically, using immunohistochemistry and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for RhoA, MEK1, ERK1, ERK2, iNOS. Retinal injury was assessed using TUNEL. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by WST-1 and TBA methods, respectively. In BOCCA rats, occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery induced degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, which was not observed in either control group. Retinal levels of RhoA, MEK1, ERK1, ERK2, iNOS, NOX2, and MDA were elevated in the BOCCA group, but not in either control group. In comparison, retinal levels of SOD were reduced in SOD animals. By immunofluorescent staining, RhoA was elevated in all retinal layers, while the increased levels of MEK, ERK1/1, and NOX were restricted to the INL, and that of ERK1/2 and NOX inner nuclear layer; iNOS elevations were observed in both the inner and outer nuclear layers. TUNEL labeling results showed that BOCCA group is higher staining than sham and control group. OIS elevates activity of the RhoA/MERK1/ERK1/2/iNOS pathways throughout the retina, likely reflecting a response to oxidative and nitrosative stress.

The osmolarity of the solutions and the osmolarity of 100 healthy and 100 alkali burned porcine corneas were determined by means of freezing point depression. 56 enucleated porcine eyes were burned and rinsed with NaCl solutions of different osmolarities (0-1200 mosmol/l), Previn, NaCl 0.9% or phosphate buffer, respectively. The different swelling behaviors were determined by pachymetric measurements, and the resulting corneal osmolarity after irrigation was assessed. The effect of Previn as a hyperosmolar solution in comparison with isoosmolar phosphate buffer was examined on 10 healthy human eyes. Only phosphate buffer and Previn show high buffer capacities. The osmolarity of the healthy/burned porcine corneas was 329+/-61/1203+/-289 mosmol/kg. Except for Previn (862+/-3 mosmol/l), all solutions are hypo- or almost isoosmolar in comparison with the healthy cornea.

Thus, the lower the solution's osmolarity, the stronger the swelling reaction of the cornea. The resulting corneal osmolarity following rinsing behaves proportionally to the osmolarity of the rinsing solution. Therefore, a high osmolarity of the rinsing solution correlates with a high corneal osmolarity. No long-term effects in healthy eyes were observed after rinsing with Previn or phosphate buffer.

All gD-DNA-injected mice obtained specific immunity. Furthermore, gD-IL-2-DNA elicited a higher DTH reaction and more vigorous cytotoxic effector cell activity. Stromal keratitis scores were lower for all immunized mice compared with control mice, although the difference in epithelial keratitis scores was not statistically significant. Viral titers in eyes, trigeminal ganglia, and brains were suppressed in all immunized mice. Local immunization with plasmid DNA encoding gD or gD-IL-2 induces humoral and cellular immunity against HSV-1 and inhibits development of stromal keratitis. gD-IL-2 DNA induces greater cell-mediated immunity than gD DNA alone. A plasmid encoding gD-IL-2 is therefore a promising candidate for a vaccine against HSV-1.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1750, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "485e4bdb-e58d-41cb-9ce1-99871417993e": {"__data__": {"id_": "485e4bdb-e58d-41cb-9ce1-99871417993e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Comparison of corneal thickness measurements using Orbscan II, non-contact specular microscopy, and ultrasonic pachymetry in eyes after laser in situ keratomileusis.", "year": "2004", "doi": "10.1136/bjo.2003.030361", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Kawana K", "Tokunaga T", "Miyata K", "Okamoto F", "Kiuchi T", "Oshika T"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f6e70b-276a-4271-8ca4-f09c94f0afde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Comparison of corneal thickness measurements using Orbscan II, non-contact specular microscopy, and ultrasonic pachymetry in eyes after laser in situ keratomileusis.", "year": "2004", "doi": "10.1136/bjo.2003.030361", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Kawana K", "Tokunaga T", "Miyata K", "Okamoto F", "Kiuchi T", "Oshika T"]}, "hash": "73a2ca6fa696d5c8630da2035757733fdcc6e24e8a12bb804f7214d1db2f3a5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7a624d7-2a85-4f34-9a26-a8dc3171315b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Preventive effect of local plasmid DNA vaccine encoding gD or gD-IL-2 on herpetic keratitis.", "year": "2000", "doi": null, "journal": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "authors": ["Inoue T", "Inoue Y", "Nakamura T", "Yoshida A", "Takahashi K", "Inoue Y", "Shimomura Y", "Tano Y", "Fujisawa Y", "Aono A", "Hayashi K"]}, "hash": "02c8d785d95efa989686bd1088452a19c77ae3b5ec719a9feea452c009b3c46d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a494d9a-fef4-479b-879c-b20ab984383d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a46287a4c333180eb979a63a2b0d41685d6510acab4fa08e03b1bd005daa7922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To compare central corneal thickness measurements of three pachymetry devices in eyes after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

Ad hoc analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials including consecutive patients 18 years and older presenting with smear-positive fungal ulcers to Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai, Coimbatore, Pondicherry, and Tirunelveli in South India who participated in 1 of 3 clinical trials: the Mycotic Ulcer Treatment Trials (MUTT) I (2010 to 2011) or II (2010 to 2015) or the Cross-Linking Assisted Infection Reduction (CLAIR) trial (2016 to 2018). This post hoc analysis was designed in March 2021 and data were analyzed in May and November 2021. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of natamycin and voriconazole was determined from corneal cultures obtained using standardized methods outlined in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The primary outcome of this post hoc analysis was MIC of natamycin and voriconazole. A total of 890 fungal isolates were obtained from 651 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.6 [13.0]; 191 [43.3%] female) from 2010 to 2018. MICs were available for 522 samples in 446 patients. Fungal isolates overall demonstrated a 1.02-fold increase per year in voriconazole resistance as measured by MICs (95% CI, 1.00-1.04; P\u2009=\u2009.06). In subgroup analyses, Fusarium species demonstrated a 1.04-fold increase in voriconazole resistance per year (95% CI, 1.00-1.06; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Fungal isolates showed a 1.06-fold increase in natamycin resistance per year overall (95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Fusarium species had a 1.06-fold increase in natamycin resistance (95% CI, 1.05-1.08; P\u2009<\u2009.001), Aspergillus had a 1.09-fold increase in resistance (95% CI, 1.05-1.15; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and other filamentous fungi had a 1.07-fold increase in resistance to natamycin per year (95% CI, 1.04-1.10; P\u2009<\u2009.001). This post hoc analysis suggests that susceptibility to both natamycin and voriconazole may be decreasing over the last decade in South India. While a trend of increasing resistance could impact treatment of mycoses in general and infectious fungal keratitis in particular, further study is needed to confirm these findings and determine their generalizability to other regions of the world.

Masked observers graded the videos for hemorrhages, avascular zones \u2265200 microns (\u03bcm), and degree of microvascular tortuosity on a four-point subjective scale. Multivariable odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and P-for trends for assessing the relation between morphological changes and POAG or XFS/XFG were obtained from logistic regression analyses.

For each 100 capillaries, the number of hemorrhages was similar (P-for trend=0.91) between XFS/XFG and POAG patients; however, there were more avascular zones per 100 capillaries with borderline significance (P-for trend=0.04) in the XFS/XFG group. XFS/XFG patients had more tortuosity than POAG patients; specifically, having a tortuosity score \u22651.5 was associated with a 4.4-fold increased odds of XFS/XFG (95% confidence interval: 1.5-13.3) relative to a tortuosity score <1.0 (P-for trend=0.005).ConclusionA high degree of nailfold capillary tortuosity is a distinct non-ocular feature associated with XFS/XFG compared with either POAG or controls.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5601f138-4cbc-4b56-99a0-815e945d4835": {"__data__": {"id_": "5601f138-4cbc-4b56-99a0-815e945d4835", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Regression Patterns of Iris Melanoma after Palladium-103 (", "year": "2017", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2017.02.015", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Chaugule SS", "Finger PT"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ba94166-e1a0-4770-9e9e-b5375b411e9c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Regression Patterns of Iris Melanoma after Palladium-103 (", "year": "2017", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2017.02.015", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Chaugule SS", "Finger PT"]}, "hash": "8fc59627aa886a9aa3af0d3f0683deeda8575e4e7288e9115afad2eb55d42f6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a550513e-4298-46b1-8c46-45a9ecea31bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Nailfold capillary morphology in exfoliation syndrome.", "year": "2017", "doi": "10.1038/eye.2016.312", "journal": "Eye (Lond)", "authors": ["Cousins CC", "Kang JH", "Bovee C", "Wang J", "Greenstein SH", "Turalba A", "Shen LQ", "Brauner S", "Boumenna T", "Blum S", "Levkovitch-Verbin H", "Ritch R", "Wiggs JL", "Knepper PA", "Pasquale LR"]}, "hash": "1aca2c49890bbbddd39f99796429f9489b7b8bbb2e6ccb4c56c1fe411ffaae6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "523aa7ef-13d0-4305-a172-84743e6ca087", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d72391781f527568d5a5180186ca4ce00c0e61e45f0a68ad72ce9b018d2c10c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To evaluate the patterns of regression of iris melanoma after treatment with palladium-103 (103Pd) plaque brachytherapy.

Transmission electron microscopy showed subtle and focal detachment of the inner wall of Schlemm's canal, rarefaction of the juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT), and cell-cell and cell-matrix detachment. Scanning electron microscopy showed collapsed vacuoles in the inner wall of Schlemm's canal and a marked increase in the number and size of border (paracellular) pores in the inner wall. Latrunculin-B increases outflow facility in postmortem human eyes. The mechanism of facility increase is most likely due to loss of mechanical integrity of the trabecular meshwork as a consequence of reduction in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. The facility increase and the extent of inner wall separation from the JCT that we observed were both qualitatively similar to that reported in living monkey eyes, but the magnitude of the facility increase and morphologic changes were much less than in the living monkey.

Frequencies of genotypes and alleles were measured by direct counting and compared between cases and controls by \u03c7(2) test. No difference could be detected between patients suffering from BD or VKH with healthy controls concerning allele and genotype frequencies of rs11755527, rs3757247, rs12212193 and rs2474619.

The IL-10 (-1082)\u2009G\u2009\u2192\u2009A polymorphism (IL-10 SNP) is associated with improved survival in certain non-CNS lymphoma patients. PDCD4 is a tumor suppressor gene and upstream regulator of IL-10. This study examined the correlation between the IL-10 SNP, PDCD4 mRNA expression, and IL-10 expression (at transcript and protein levels) in these lymphoma cells. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing at IL-10 (-1082) was performed after microdissecting cytospun PVRL cells from 26 specimens. Vitreal IL-10 and IL-6 levels were measured by ELISA. PCNSL cells from 52 paraffin-embedded sections were microdissected and SNP typed on genomic DNA. RT-PCR was performed to analyze expression of IL-10 and PDCD4 mRNA. IL-10 (-1082) SNP typing was performed on blood samples of 96 healthy controls. We measured IL-10 (-1082) SNP expression in 26 PVRLs and 52 PCNSLs and examined its relationship with IL-10 protein and gene expression, respectively. More PVRL patients expressed one copy of the IL-10 ( -1082 )\u2009 G\u2009\u2192\u2009A SNP with the GA genotype compared to controls. The frequencies of the three genotypes (AA, AG, GG) significantly differed in PVRL versus controls and in PCNSL versus controls. In PVRLs, the vitreal IL-10/IL-6 ratio was higher in IL-10 (-1082) AG and IL-10 (-1082) AA patients, compared to IL-10 (-1082) GG patients. IL-10 mRNA expression was higher in IL-10 (-1082) AG and IL-10 (-1082) AA PCNSLs, compared to IL-10 (-1082) GG PCNSLs. No correlation was found between IL-10 and PDCD4 expression levels in 37 PCNSL samples. PVRL and PCNSL patients had similar IL-10 (-1082) A allele frequencies, but genotype distributions differed from healthy controls. The findings suggest that the IL-10 (-1082) A allele is a risk factor for higher IL-10 levels in PVRLs and PCNSLs.

Studies of tumour doubling time have indicated that metastasis from choroidal melanoma can occur quite early in the course of the disease, when the tumour is about 3.0 mm in basal dimension and 1.5 mm in thickness. Clinical studies have shown that, at 5 years, metastasis occurs in 16% of patients with small choroidal melanomas (less than 4 mm thick), compared with 32% of those with medium-sized (4-8 mm thick) choroidal melanomas and 53% of those with large (more than 8 mm thick) choroidal melanomas. The difficulty with early detection of choroidal melanoma relates to its clinical similarity to benign choroidal nevus. Factors that assist in differentiating small choroidal melanoma from choroidal nevus can be remembered using the mnemonic \"TFSOM\" (to find small ocular melanoma), where T = thickness greater than 2 mm, F = subretinal fluid, S = symptoms, O = orange pigment and M = margin touching optic disc. Choroidal melanocytic tumours that display none of these factors have a 3% risk of growth into melanoma at 5 years and most likely represent choroidal nevi. Tumours that display one factor have a 38% risk of growth, and those with two or more factors show growth in over 50% of cases. Most tumours with two or more risk factors probably represent small choroidal melanomas, and early treatment is generally indicated.

This was a clinic-based study of 16 patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent worse than -6 dioptres or axial length (AL)\u2009\u2265\u200926.5\u2009mm) recruited from the High Myopia clinic of the Singapore National Eye Centre. MMD was graded from fundus photographs according to the Meta-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification. Severe MMD was defined as META-PM category 3 or 4. AL and logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured. Sera were obtained from subjects and analysed for the presence of ARAs with the western blot technique. The mean AL was significantly longer in patients with severe MMD (n\u2009=\u20098) than those without severe MMD (n\u2009=\u20098) (31.50 vs. 28.51, p\u2009=\u20090.005). There was at least one ARA identified in all patients. The most common ARA was anti-carbonic anhydrase II (anti-CAII), present in nine patients (56.3%). Anti-CAII was detected in more patients with severe MMD than those without (75 vs. 37.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.32). LogMar BCVA was also worse in subjects with anti-CAII (0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38 vs. 0.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, p\u2009=\u20090.06).

A clinical audit was also carried out on 65 successive patients using a questionnaire to determine the acceptability of LA to patients and surgeons. Anatomical and visual success rates, and intra-operative and post-operative complications, were similar in cases carried out under LA and GA. The mean duration of the surgery (excluding anaesthetic time) was significantly shorter for LA than GA procedures (p < 0.001).

Myopic maculopathy was defined according to the criteria of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group classification system. Trends in the prevalence of myopia and myopic maculopathy were tested by using a logistic regression analysis fitted by generalized estimating equations to account for individuals submitting to repeated examination. The age-adjusted frequencies of myopia increased significantly from 2005 to 2017 (myopia, 37.7%-45.8%; high myopia 5.8%-9.5%; all P for trend <0.001). The age-adjusted frequency of an axial length level of 26.5 mm or more increased significantly from 2005 to 2017 (3.6%-6.0%; P for trend <0.001). The age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy also increased significantly with time (1.6% in 2005, 3.0% in 2012 and 3.6% in 2017; P for trend <0.001). Upward trends were observed in the prevalence of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy and patchy chorioretinal atrophy (all P for trend <0.05). Our findings suggest that the prevalence of myopia and myopic maculopathy, especially diffuse chorioretinal atrophy and patchy chorioretinal atrophy, increased significantly over the past 12 years in a general Japanese population.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9b55a9f-669c-49d6-948e-18e6c3d238ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9b55a9f-669c-49d6-948e-18e6c3d238ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Dry eye symptoms align more closely to non-ocular conditions than to tear film parameters.", "year": "2015", "doi": "10.1136/bjophthalmol-2014-306481", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Galor A", "Felix ER", "Feuer W", "Shalabi N", "Martin ER", "Margolis TP", "Sarantopoulos CD", "Levitt RC"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "007f85c9-0527-4212-a882-7e2b2915851a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Dry eye symptoms align more closely to non-ocular conditions than to tear film parameters.", "year": "2015", "doi": "10.1136/bjophthalmol-2014-306481", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Galor A", "Felix ER", "Feuer W", "Shalabi N", "Martin ER", "Margolis TP", "Sarantopoulos CD", "Levitt RC"]}, "hash": "d5a32435e96b59ae7f0575ad101f492a131ae0d8c69ba6d9da458649bcdafc73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9eb7af31-89e9-492b-b189-e4018655de9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Trends in the Prevalence of Myopia and Myopic Maculopathy in a Japanese Population: The Hisayama Study.", "year": "2019", "doi": "10.1167/iovs.19-26580", "journal": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "authors": ["Ueda E", "Yasuda M", "Fujiwara K", "Hashimoto S", "Ohno-Matsui K", "Hata J", "Ishibashi T", "Ninomiya T", "Sonoda KH"]}, "hash": "6e8f124621730fa0e31ea765c505eaf5e88589761229cc47a810fa65efbddafc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "efac8c9b-d8d4-4a5a-9b7e-e9e6ec46795f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6098c953d47735712f51e2532e26efd6f74fbedcc33d61f843e0420f7006187", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To evaluate the relationship between dry eye symptoms, non-ocular conditions and tear film parameters.

The effect of Y-27632 on the barrier function of the confluent SCE-cell monolayer was evaluated by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein permeability. Y-27632-induced changes in the intracellular localization of ZO-1, claudin-5, \u03b2-catenin, pan-cadherin, and filamentous actin (F-actin) were examined by immunofluorescence.

The concentrations of intracellular calcium ions were estimated using Fluo-4/AM and a fluorescence microscope system. Y-27632 significantly increased the outflow facility and the number of associated giant vacuoles, decreased TEER of the SCE-cell monolayer, and increased the transendothelial flux of fluorescein. Y-27632 disrupted ZO-1 and claudin-5 expression in a confluent SCE-cell monolayer. Among 12,544 genes, Y-27632 treatment increased the expression of 57 genes and decreased the expression of 15 genes.

Forty-seven participants with childhood glaucoma (defined as disease onset <18 years) recruited from the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma (ANZRAG). A qualitative research methodology (interpretive phenomenology) was applied, and data were collected through semistructured in-depth interviews.

Mean participant age was 40.0 \u00b1 15.3 years, and 55% of participants were female. We identified 10 QoL themes pertinent to adults living with childhood glaucoma. Coping strategies and emotional well-being were the most prominent themes. Maladaptive coping strategies, including treatment nonadherence, were observed more commonly in individuals aged <40 years and those without a vision impairment or reviewed less regularly. Emotional well-being was affected by feelings of being misunderstood because of the rarity of the condition, being self-conscious of physical manifestations of the disease, and anxiety related to possible disease progression and vision loss. The effect of childhood glaucoma on family planning formed a novel QoL theme and included worry for their child to inherit the condition and an inability to fulfill parental duties. This often led to genetic counseling-seeking behaviors. Mobility issues were infrequently experienced. Childhood glaucoma poses a substantial impact to the emotional well-being of adults with the condition, which is mediated by the use of coping strategies. Genetic counseling and family planning options may be important.

All children with newly diagnosed congenital and infantile cataract in the United Kingdom in 1 year from October 1995 through September 1996 were identified using independent ophthalmic and pediatric national active surveillance schemes. Capture-recapture analysis was used to estimate completeness of ascertainment. Annual age-specific and cumulative incidence were estimated and adjusted for ascertainment. Two hundred forty-eight children with newly diagnosed congenital or infantile cataract were identified-an estimated 92% of eligible cases. The adjusted annual age-specific incidence of new diagnosis of congenital and infantile cataract was highest in the first year of life, being 2.49 per 10,000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.10-2.87). Adjusted cumulative incidence at 5 years was 3.18 per 10,000 (95% CI, 2.76-3.59), increasing to 3.46 per 10,000 by 15 years (95% CI, 3.02-3.90).

Primary cultures of mouse mixed retinal cells and mouse M\u00fcller glia were used for evaluating the effects of E-LPs on the expression of \u03b12-macroglobulin. Intravitreal injection of E-LPs protected the optic nerve from degeneration and attenuated the increase in \u03b12-macroglobulin in aqueous humor and retina of rats. E-LPs directly decreased the expression and secretion of \u03b12-macroglobulin in primary cultures of M\u00fcller glia; this decrease in production of \u03b12-macroglobulin was blocked by knockdown of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) with small interfering RNA. E-LPs promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas Stattic, an inhibitor of STAT3, restored the expression of \u03b12-macroglobulin decreased by E-LPs. In addition to our previous findings of the protection of RGCs by E-LPs, the new observations in M\u00fcller glia indicate that a reduction of the intraocular \u03b12-macroglobulin, regulated by the E-LP-LRP1-STAT3 pathway, might be an additional protective mechanism against excitotoxicity in the retina.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1756, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f866d062-4628-4177-a5f6-567a11504a1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f866d062-4628-4177-a5f6-567a11504a1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "A Comparison between the Compass Fundus Perimeter and the Humphrey Field Analyzer.", "year": "2019", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2018.08.010", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Montesano G", "Bryan SR", "Crabb DP", "Fogagnolo P", "Oddone F", "McKendrick AM", "Turpin A", "Lanzetta P", "Perdicchi A", "Johnson CA", "Garway-Heath DF", "Brusini P", "Rossetti LM"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a8fb93b-21c6-4ab6-905b-485539e6879d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "A Comparison between the Compass Fundus Perimeter and the Humphrey Field Analyzer.", "year": "2019", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2018.08.010", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Montesano G", "Bryan SR", "Crabb DP", "Fogagnolo P", "Oddone F", "McKendrick AM", "Turpin A", "Lanzetta P", "Perdicchi A", "Johnson CA", "Garway-Heath DF", "Brusini P", "Rossetti LM"]}, "hash": "39b1551585b970b3d541ba245d52654b66e4fa483c26f0cfd206f95948e9a4e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "217b7c16-bc61-46ca-942c-c09311a31fef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Apolipoprotein E-Containing Lipoproteins and LRP1 Protect From NMDA-Induced Excitotoxicity Associated With Reducing \u03b12-Macroglobulin in M\u00fcller Glia.", "year": "2021", "doi": "10.1167/iovs.62.13.23", "journal": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "authors": ["Hayashi H", "Mori M", "Harashima M", "Hashizume T", "Furiya M", "Mukaigaito C", "Takemura E", "Yamada M", "Mise K", "Yuan B", "Takagi N"]}, "hash": "ed7c08fcdd3c55b93ed5a3922f25b67e95afb81a0af6ea2c20e4dd391091a705", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf5f6afd-9807-42e1-b9a8-5af4860f494e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63bcc09b20fa171dda57b8f68aae015e993d046ba621d5d71f28f66ecdf78db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To evaluate relative diagnostic precision and test-retest variability of 2 devices, the Compass (CMP, CenterVue, Padova, Italy) fundus perimeter and the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA, Zeiss, Dublin, CA), in detecting glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON).

A separate group of 44 patients with glaucoma and 54 normal subjects was analyzed to assess test-retest variability. One eye of recruited subjects was tested with the index tests: HFA (Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm [SITA] standard strategy) and CMP (Zippy Estimation by Sequential Testing [ZEST] strategy), 24-2 grid. The reference test for GON was specialist evaluation of fundus photographs or OCT, independent of the visual field (VF). For both devices, linear regression was used to calculate the sensitivity decrease with age in the normal group to compute pointwise total deviation (TD) values and mean deviation (MD). We derived 5% and 1% pointwise normative limits. The MD and the total number of TD values below 5% (TD 5%) or 1% (TD 1%) limits per field were used as classifiers. We used partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) curves and partial area under the curve (pAUC) to compare the diagnostic precision of the devices. Pointwise mean absolute deviation and Bland-Altman plots for the mean sensitivity (MS) were computed to assess test-retest variability.

Demographic, systemic, gestational, and birth data were collected. Generalized additive regression models were used to analyze the data. Fifty-one children (51 eyes) were recruited, 19 full-term and 32 preterm children, mean age at ophthalmic examination of 10.58 (4.21) and 14.13 (3.16), respectively. In multivariable analysis, the preterm group's retinal thickness was significantly decreased in total retina nasal outer sector, ganglion cell layer (GCL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL), specifically GCL temporal outer (p\u2009=\u20090.010), GCL superior outer (p\u2009=\u20090.009), IPL temporal outer (p\u2009=\u20090.022), and IPL superior outer (p\u2009=\u20090.004), when compared with full-term group. From the variables compared only with birth head circumference that influenced the models, a non-linear association was identified and consequently modeled with splines through a generalized additive model. This study suggests that preterm children without ROP have structural retinal alterations, mostly in GCL and IPL in outer areas of the macula. Therefore, it is crucial to question gestational history since these retinal changes may be found later in life leading to useless investigation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1820, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cb33cd7-2157-4acd-a4cb-9c2e1c8beef9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cb33cd7-2157-4acd-a4cb-9c2e1c8beef9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Variability of panretinal photocoagulation lesions across physicians and patients.

To compare the short-term effects of consumption of dark chocolate with those of milk chocolate on visual acuity and large- and small-letter contrast sensitivity. A randomized, single-masked crossover design was used to assess short-term visual performance after consumption of a dark or a milk chocolate bar. Thirty participants without pathologic eye disease each consumed dark and milk chocolate in separate sessions, and within-participant paired comparisons were used to assess outcomes. Testing was conducted at the Rosenberg School of Optometry from June 25 to August 15, 2017. Visual acuity (in logMAR units) and large- and small-letter contrast sensitivity (in the log of the inverse of the minimum detectable contrast [logCS units]) were measured 1.75 hours after consumption of dark and milk chocolate bars. Among the 30 participants (9 men and 21 women; mean [SD] age, 26 [5] years), small-letter contrast sensitivity was significantly higher after consumption of dark chocolate (mean [SE], 1.45 [0.04] logCS) vs milk chocolate (mean [SE], 1.30 [0.05] logCS; mean improvement, 0.15 logCS [95% CI, 0.08-0.22 logCS]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

Adenylate cyclase activity was assessed by the determination of cellular adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels and the effects of serotonin on both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels studied. Serotonin at 100 microM had no effect on the basal levels of cAMP in cultured human RPE cells, but attenuated by 43.6% the stimulation in cAMP production induced by forskolin (5 microM). This effect was dose dependent for serotonin with half-maximal inhibition (EC50) occurring at approximately 1.5 x 10(-9) M. The 5-HT1 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy [2-di-n-propylamino] tetralin (8-OH DPAT), buspirone, 5-carboxyamidotryptamine, and RU24969 mimicked the inhibitory effect of serotonin in a dose-dependent manner. The actions of serotonin and 8-OH DPAT (10 microM) were dose-dependently attenuated by the serotonergic antagonists spiroxatrine, propranolol, and spiperone. Pretreatment of RPE cell cultures with pertussis toxin abolished the serotonin-induced reduction of forskolin-elevated cAMP levels. Stimulation of cAMP production by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol at 0.1 microM, but not at 10 microM or 100 microM, also was attenuated by serotonin (100 microM), whereas cAMP production induced by the adenosine receptor agonist 5'-[N-ethyl]-carboxamidoadenosine (NECA) at 1 microM, 10 microM, and 100 microM was unaffected. Serotonin and 8-OH DPAT dose-dependently inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated (0.1 microM) cAMP production with EC50 values of approximately 10 microM, and pertussis toxin pretreatment partially blocked these effects. Cultured human RPE cells possess 5-HT1A receptors negatively coupled to cAMP production through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.

Causes were classified into preventable or treatable conditions and analysed for trends.ResultsFive hundred and ninety-eight children were registered as having impaired vision over the 28-year period. A total of 22% had preventable or treatable conditions. Optic atrophy was the most common cause responsible for 16% of registrations followed by albinism (12%), cerebral visual impairment (11%), congenital cataract (8%), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (8%), and congenital motor nystagmus (7%). The incident rate (per million population aged <16 years) for registerable vision loss due to congenital cataract decreased from 5.89 (CI 2.82-10.83) in 1984-1987 to 2.63 (CI 0.72-6.74) in 2008-2011. For ROP, the incident rate peaked during 2000-2003 at 8.87 (CI 4.85-14.88). Thereafter, there was a statistically significant reduction in incident rate to 1.98 (CI 0.41-5.77) in 2008-2011 (P=0.008).ConclusionsSight-impairment registrations due to preventable or treatable causes have decreased over the past 28 years.

On OCTA, 25.0% of the eyes with buried ODD showed a C-shaped vessel density decrease in the nasal radial peripapillary capillary layer, while 40.3% of the eyes with ODE had nonspecific focal vessel density decrease around the optic nerve head. Larger ODD were significantly associated with a vessel density decrease on OCTA (P\u00a0= .009).

Eight different, reproducible combinations of cutting conditions were applied, and ten epithelial, full-thickness trephinations were performed for each combination. The endothelial defect was measured with a light microscope (60 x). In addition, the bend radii of the porcine cornea were measured.

A cutting power of 392 mN combined with a rotation rate of 840 rev/min increased the defect to 126%. The system allowed full-thickness 360 degrees trephination. The corneal bend radii in porcine eyes measured 8.28 mm horizontally and 8.20 mm vertically.

No patient showed major changes in renal function: 3/21 patients (14.28%) showed slightly abnormal (less than 30%) function at the end of the first month of treatment; 1/21 (4.76%) patients at 3 months, but at the end of a 6-month treatment period only 1/21 patients (4.76%) showed minor abnormality in renal function. The mean daily prednisolone dose was 19.7\u2009mg at the beginning of the study, which had fallen to 6.9\u2009mg at the end (t=5.071, p=0.001). Visual acuity mostly remained stable. Visual fields improved over time (mean improvement in Humphrey mean deviation, right eye=1.8\u00b12.4\u2009dB, t=3.821, p=0.004; left eye=1.9\u00b12.7,\u2009dB, t=3.06, p=0.007). Electrophysiological function showed improvement in 10 patients, and in four patients an initial deterioration in function improved following tacrolimus dose adjustment. Tacrolimus has a good safety profile for long-term use in patients with BRC as a second-line agent enabling steroid sparing and visual function stabilisation or improvement.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1788, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ba24631-c84a-42f6-b444-4f81cbdeb1c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ba24631-c84a-42f6-b444-4f81cbdeb1c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Long-term outcomes of primary transcanalicular laser dacryocystorhinostomy.", "year": "2021", "doi": "10.1007/s00417-021-05165-5", "journal": "Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Nowak R", "Rekas M", "Gospodarowicz IN", "Ali MJ"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35bdae28-b52d-439a-812e-2792e481f4d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Long-term outcomes of primary transcanalicular laser dacryocystorhinostomy.", "year": "2021", "doi": "10.1007/s00417-021-05165-5", "journal": "Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Nowak R", "Rekas M", "Gospodarowicz IN", "Ali MJ"]}, "hash": "7e84d9649848eff4e87af10870e9e9c9795d1c8772d1c1fd4f81080a5ddded7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cbf8ad0-84b1-4f33-8f65-5acf1f5aaf44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Safety profile and efficacy of tacrolimus in the treatment of birdshot retinochoroiditis: a retrospective case series review.", "year": "2018", "doi": "10.1136/bjophthalmol-2017-310436", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Islam F", "Westcott M", "Rees A", "Robson AG", "Kapoor B", "Holder G", "Pavesio C"]}, "hash": "9b05776d3c50ce728f0a2c14e8f2210a6aab620298112ad48702e37fd97df79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd714336-68c9-417d-b403-bee57205f781", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b240e24093b36624d926ef4e18b604998ad2102fe757322ea5579293802feb2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To assess the long-term outcomes of transcanalicular laser dacryocystorhinostomy in cases of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). Retrospective interventional case series was performed on all patients diagnosed with PANDO and who underwent a primary transcanalicular laser dacryocystorhinostomy from Jan 2014 to June 2016. The procedure was performed using 980 nm diode laser. All the patients additionally underwent intraoperative adjunctive procedures: mitomycin C application and silicone intubation. Patients were followed for up to 3 years after surgery. Anatomical success was defined as patent ostium on irrigation, and functional success was defined as resolution of epiphora. The parameters studied include patient demographics, clinical presentation, type of anesthesia, duration of surgery, laser energy delivered, complications, and anatomical and functional success. The variables influencing the outcomes were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using the package Statistica (version 10.0, Statsoft, Poland). A total number of 205 patients were assessed. Of these, 73.17% (150/205) were females. The mean age of patients was 62.92 years. The mean laser energy used was 1060.09 J, and the mean operating time was 22.33 min. Approximately, 95% and 68% of the patients completed 1 year and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. The anatomical and functional success rates dropped significantly beyond the 3 months and 6 months postoperative period and maintained the lower success rates beyond 1-year follow-up for up to 3 years. The anatomical and functional success at the end of 3-year follow-up was 56.12% and 33.81%, respectively. The functional success was not affected by gender (P = 0.132), age (P = 0.956), laser energy (P = 0.626), or duration of the surgery (P = 0.906). However, the intraoperative pain scale was influenced by the laser energy (P < 0.001) and the duration of the surgery (P < 0.001).

However, they could also be involved in photoreceptor homeostasis under basal, nonstressful conditions. Therefore, we aimed to study glucocorticoid-induced changes of survival-related molecules in male mice retinas under standard illumination conditions (12 hours light, \u2264 60 lux/12 h dark). Male Balb-c mice were injected with dexamethasone (DEX), a selective glucocorticoid receptor \u03b1 (GR\u03b1) agonist, its antagonist mifepristone (MFP), or both drugs (D+M) at noon. A group of mice was subjected to surgical adrenalectomy (AdrX). Retinas were studied by histology, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL procedure, and Western blotting at different periods after pharmacological or surgical intervention (6 hours, 48 hours, or 7 days). The antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-X(L) significantly increased 6 hours after DEX injection. By contrast, this molecule could no longer be found after MFP injection. At the same time, high levels of cleaved caspase-3 (CC-3) and Bax appeared in retinal extracts, and TUNEL(+) nuclei selectively showed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). After MFP, retinal extracts also contained phosphorylated histone H2AX (p-H2AX), a marker of DNA breakage and repair. Loss of ONL nuclear rows and decrease of rhodopsin levels were evident 7 days after MFP administration. These changes were minimized when DEX was given together with MFP (D+M). In the absence of MFP, DEX increased Bcl-X(L) in every retinal layer, with a marked intensification in photoreceptor inner segments. Numerous TUNEL(+) nuclei rapidly appeared in the ONL after AdrX. A single dose of MFP induced selective photoreceptor damage in the absence of other environmental stressors. Because damage was prevented by DEX, and was reproduced by AdrX, our findings suggest that glucocorticoids play a critical role in photoreceptor survival.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79c95eca-7bca-49cd-8db3-57959cbddcaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "79c95eca-7bca-49cd-8db3-57959cbddcaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Ophthalmic artery flow velocity in glaucomatous and normal subjects.", "year": "1993", "doi": "10.1136/bjo.77.1.25", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Rojanapongpun P", "Drance SM", "Morrison BJ"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d7b2056-ebd5-4e9c-b634-01aeffdab64b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Ophthalmic artery flow velocity in glaucomatous and normal subjects.", "year": "1993", "doi": "10.1136/bjo.77.1.25", "journal": "Br J Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Rojanapongpun P", "Drance SM", "Morrison BJ"]}, "hash": "c875135ed309f8c04023dbfa40de39b79e78cc1c63fd7fb96a07a74b2a8aa83b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09571a19-83b5-45be-918c-998a5236fb10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Mifepristone, a blocker of glucocorticoid receptors, promotes photoreceptor death.", "year": "2013", "doi": "10.1167/iovs.12-10014", "journal": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "authors": ["Cubilla MA", "Berm\u00fadez V", "Marquioni Ramella MD", "Bachor TP", "Suburo AM"]}, "hash": "2b602aaf2633907006e6837f88287ee4020dedce2735ceadc1f4b0517cd93978", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "52ed7156-0d9b-4a4b-96de-f020f874a146", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc5a8f29b4344c2f90ec31c60d8257e18c6e40f04da6dac7ade804e90ff3ae17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The velocity of blood flow in the ophthalmic artery was measured with a transcranial Doppler ultrasound (2 MHz).

This retrospective analysis compared LASIK outcomes with the femtosecond laser to those with the Carriazo-Barraquer (CB) microkeratome (Moria, Inc.) and the Hansatome microkeratome (Bausch & Lomb, Inc.). The 3 groups were matched for enrollment criteria and were operated on under similar conditions by the same surgeon. There were 106 eyes in the IntraLase group, 126 eyes in the CB group, and 143 eyes in the Hansatome group. One day postoperatively, the uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) results in the 3 groups were similar; at 3 months, the UCVA and the best spectacle-corrected visual acuity results were not significantly different. A manifest spheroequivalent of +/-0.50 diopter (D) was achieved in 91% of eyes in the IntraLase group, 73% of eyes in the CB group, and 74% of eyes in the Hansatome group (P<.01). IntraLase flaps were significantly thinner (P<.01) and varied less in thickness (P<.01) than flaps created with the other devices.

Mean blur rate can be used in the study of retinal diseases to evaluate microcirculation in the retinal vessels, choroid, and optic nerve head. In addition to overall MBR (MA), LSFG measurements of optic nerve head microcirculation can be divided into vessel-area MBR (MV) and tissue-area MBR (MT).

Transcripts of recorded interviews were evaluated using NVivo software. Specific concerns were identified and coded, and broad themes were identified. The frequency of each theme was calculated, with the frequency of specific concerns within each theme.ResultsRegarding the child's experience, 6 themes were identified: Visual Function (mentioned by 16 of 16 children (100%) and by 26 of 31 parents (84%), Social (94 and 65%), Treatment (81 and 90%), Worry (75 and 10%), Emotions (63 and 68%), and Physical Discomfort (63 and 26%).

Experimental glaucoma in monkeys reduces visual afference to the central nervous system, thereby reducing the metabolic drive as indicated by COR. The detrimental effect of glaucoma did not appear to be any greater for the M-cell, rather than the P-cell pathway in the LGN or in the visual cortex.

An increase in the specific green and blue fluorescence was observed with increasing age in the soluble and insoluble nuclear fractions. In the cortical fractions, an increase with age was observed in lenses of donors under 30 yr old. No significant variations in the specific fluorescence were measured beyond the third/fourth decade of life in the cortical fractions.

The age and sex standardized incidences of first time treatment and changes in duration of treatment were analysed. The number of patients in active treatment increased from 576 in 2007 to 3684 in 2019. The growth was initially driven by accumulation of patients continuing anti-VEGF therapy for extended periods of time (259 patients/year). As larger numbers of patients began to be discharged, the increase slowed to 181 patients/year in late 2010s, with demographic change becoming the main growth driving factor. The incidence of first treatment increased slightly during the study period, mainly for individuals over 85\u2009years. For patients under 85\u2009years, treatment incidences closely followed neovascular AMD incidences from population studies. The likelihood of remaining in anti-VEGF treatment after the initial injection followed exponential decay curve (t1/2 \u2009=\u20093.6\u2009years). Based on this observation, a model was created to describe the number of patients in active treatment, which accurately described historical data (R2 \u2009=\u20090.999), and forecast a linear growth of 138 patients/year until 2030.

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical features, management, and prognosis of patients with uveal metastasis from breast cancer. Retrospective interventional case series. We retrospectively reviewed 264 consecutive patients with uveal metastasis from breast cancer. We assessed the clinical features of the patient and tumor at the time of presentation, management, and prognosis. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to analyze the probability of death as a function of time. Uveal metastasis was the initial manifestation of breast cancer in seven patients (3%) and the first systemic metastatic site of previously diagnosed breast cancer in 43 (16%). Associated with uveal metastasis, optic disk metastasis was found in 13 patients (5%), eyelid metastasis in one patient (1%), and conjunctival and orbital in one patient (<1%). Of 264 patients with uveal metastasis, 225 (85%) had choroidal metastasis, eight (3%) iris metastasis, two (<1%) ciliary body metastasis, and 29 (11%) had metastasis in multiple uveal sites. In the 264 patients with uveal metastasis, the most common symptom was blurred vision in 197 patients (88%), floaters in 15 (5%), photopsia in 12 (5%), and 19 (7%) were asymptomatic. The uveal metastases were bilateral in 99 patients (38%) and unilateral in 165 (62%). In 55 (56%) of the 99 bilateral cases, a uveal metastasis was found in the asymptomatic fellow eye during follow-up examination. External beam radiotherapy was used in 137 patients with uveal metastasis (52%), providing tumor control in 116 patients (85%) at a mean follow-up of 21 months. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates, survival rates of all patients with uveal metastasis from breast cancer was 65% at 1-year, 34% at 3-year, and 24% at 5-year follow-up.

Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3 were examined by immunofluorescence and quantified using Image J. Molecules with different Stokes radius (Rs) were allowed simultaneously to diffuse through mouse BrM/Ch mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. Samples were quantified using gel exclusion chromatography. HSPGs and C/DSPGs were markedly increased in Efemp1ki/ki Bruch's membrane, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 were decreased, but TIMP-3 was increased.

Considering dietary intakes of vitamins C and E, zinc, lutein/zeaxanthin, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and low-dietary glycemic index (dGI) from AREDS baseline information, we assigned each nutrient a percentile rank score then summed them into a compound score for each participant.

Validation, fitness, and performance of the model were evaluated using bootstrapping techniques, adjusted quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion, and the c-index, respectively. Stereoscopic fundus photographs of the macula were taken and graded at baseline using the AREDS protocol and AMD Classification System. Our results showed that higher compound scores were associated with lower risk for early AMD, indicated by drusen, and advanced AMD.

We extracted incident uveal melanoma patients using the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) database, which covered the entire population from 1999 to 2012 in South Korea. We estimated all-cause survival probabilities and cancer-specific survival probabilities of patients with uveal melanoma and compared these probabilities between subgroups (sex, tumor site, age at diagnosis, etc.) using Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank tests. We fitted the Cox-proportional hazards models for all-cause death and cancer death to determine sex disparities in survival. A total of 344 uveal melanoma patients (175 women, 51%) were ascertained. They comprised 283 patients with choroidal melanoma (82%) and 61 patients with ciliary body/iris melanoma (18%). The observed 5-year survival probability from all-cause death was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 69%-79%); women with uveal melanoma showed higher survival probability (83% [95% CI: 76%-89%]) compared with men (66% [95% CI: 58%-73%], P < 0.01). After adjusting for age, year of diagnosis, tumor sites, and diagnostic verification method, the hazards for all-cause death and cancer death in women with uveal melanoma were lower than those in men (hazards ratio for cancer death = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.30-0.81]; hazards ratio for all-cause death = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.61]). Women with uveal melanoma have better survival probabilities relative to men with uveal melanoma.

Two retinas attached completely after 48 hr of binocular occlusion, four responded to local sponge buckles and one to a temporary balloon buckle. All attached without drainage of subretinal fluid.

Because the technique is performed manually, it is difficult to standardize, and stimuli are often presented too quickly. Automated kinetic perimetry has been successfully established in adults, but to date no results have been published in children. This paper describes the feasibility and outcome of automated kinetic perimetry in children in a standard clinical setting. Fifty children aged 5-14 years were examined using a Twinfield perimeter (Oculus Inc., Wetzlar, Germany), including healthy children, children with unilateral pathologies (normal eye tested) and children with unilateral strabismus (non-affected eye tested). Kinetic perimetry was performed using stimuli III(4), I(4), I(2) and I(1) (Goldmann standard) with a test velocity of 2 degrees/s. Whenever possible, each test was performed twice. Automated and/or manual re-testing was possible on the same device whenever indicated. Automated kinetic perimetry took about 3.5 min per eye and could be completed more quickly than manual Goldmann perimetry, despite the lower test velocity. All children--with the exception of one 11 year old--were able to perform the test at least once. There was no significant correlation between age and the isopters or the area inside the isopters. No significant difference was found between children with and without strabismus. In 49 out of 50 children (98%) automatic kinetic perimetry was possible in a clinical setting using a commercially available Twinfield perimeter in a session of clinically practical duration. A major advantage is constant test velocity, independent of the examiner. Test performance was not only dependent on age, but also on the child's maturity and ability to concentrate. Older children tended to detect the stimuli more peripherally. Older children got better results from the examiner evaluation parameters attention and central fixation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1959, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49eeaf23-6d3e-4a77-b65f-e0f80a492b09": {"__data__": {"id_": "49eeaf23-6d3e-4a77-b65f-e0f80a492b09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Update on bacterial conjunctivitis in South Florida.", "year": "2008", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.03.076", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Cavuoto K", "Zutshi D", "Karp CL", "Miller D", "Feuer W"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa1f7cc0-3fe8-498b-aa13-70ce0a16e8fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Update on bacterial conjunctivitis in South Florida.", "year": "2008", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.03.076", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Cavuoto K", "Zutshi D", "Karp CL", "Miller D", "Feuer W"]}, "hash": "c35a81a4ab1fdd29d332ad5710041f897646222379a8e7efe8dcad8cebb087a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca0739a5-82c1-40f1-b190-1d9ade71a1f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Feasibility and outcome of automated kinetic perimetry in children.", "year": "2010", "doi": "10.1007/s00417-010-1342-9", "journal": "Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol", "authors": ["Wilscher S", "Wabbels B", "Lorenz B"]}, "hash": "2958a7e5838907136ca9502e19a3f948c7a3a2d4d1dc0b8039397d6f1f95ff5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1068567b-ca55-4972-906a-32de49c58c7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5e80a9ff370e241078253e4d1eafe230ef96f8a65c2fab7b52e1c090f2a0dc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To report demographics, organism occurrence, and in vitro resistance trends for patients presenting with bacterial conjunctivitis at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Florida from 1994 to 2003.

The total photopigment (retinal plus pigment epithelial fractions) per eye was examined for significant changes with age, using the higher value from pairs of eyes. The median rhodopsin content of the higher eye of adults is 6.45 nmoles (range, 3.33-10.84 nmoles) with 8 nmoles or more recovered from 28% of all adult eyes. The rhodopsin content of infants' eyes (< 12 months post-term) is significantly lower than that of older individuals and increases with age. After infancy, no change with age is found. For both infants and adults, 9-cis retinal significantly increases the amount of photopigment recovered without reducing the variance in the amount of photopigment recovered. The rhodopsin content is estimated to be 50% of the median adult amount early in infancy, approximately 5 weeks postterm (95% confidence interval, 0-10 weeks postterm). A developmental increase in rhodopsin content occurs during infancy. Thereafter rhodopsin content remains constant. The amount of rhodopsin recovered from human eyes is quite variable.

A domestic cat model was developed in which long-term in vivo studies were performed. After dose-response studies in primary human TM cells, 19 cats received anterior chamber (AC) injections of stepped doses (10(6)-10(8) transduction units) of lentiviral vectors encoding different marker transgenes (beta-galactosidase, Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein [GFP], or Renilla reniformis GFP). Animals were monitored serially for transgene expression and IOP. High-grade, stable transgene expression in the TM was achieved and monitored noninvasively over time in living animals. Extensive expression resulted after a single transcorneal injection, persisted for at least 10 months (time of death in the present studies), and was targeted to the TM. The initial IOP did not differ significantly from the IOP at the end of the study (P = 0.4). Aequorea GFP was superior to Renilla GFP. Vectors were effective enough to cause GFP-specific overexpression cytotoxicity at the highest dose, which was solved by dose reduction. High-grade transgene expression in this large-animal model persisted stably for at least 10 months after a single transcorneal lentiviral vector injection, was highly targeted, and could be monitored serially and noninvasively in living animals.

The first acylation step in the synthesis of Plgs is catalyzed by the enzyme glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT), which is also known as dihydroxyacetone phosphate-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42). GNPAT deficiency produces rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2, a genetic disorder associated with developmental ocular defects. Despite the relevance of retinal Plgs, our knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate their synthesis, and the role of GNPAT during eye development is limited. Using the Xenopus laevis model organism, we characterized by in situ hybridization the expression pattern of gnpat and compared it to glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase mitochondrial (gpam or gpat1) during eye neurogenesis, lamination, and morphogenesis. The Xenopus Gnpat was biochemically characterized in a heterologous expression system in yeast. During development, gnpat is expressed in proliferative cells of the retina and lens, and post-embryogenesis in proliferative cells of the ciliary marginal zone and lens epithelium. In contrast, gpam expression is mainly restricted to photoreceptors. Xenopus Gnpat expressed in yeast is present in both soluble and membrane fractions, but only the membrane-bound enzyme displays activity. The amino terminal of Gnpat, conserved in humans, shows lipid binding capacity that is enhanced by phosphatidic acid. Enzymes involved in the Plgs and glycerophospholipid biosynthetic pathways are differentially expressed during eye morphogenesis.

To investigate the association between depression and severity of DED symptoms and signs, including inflammatory markers. Secondary cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis performed in April to December 2020 of data from Dry Eye Assessment and Management (DREAM) study, a randomized clinical trial from October 2014 to July 2016 including patients with moderate to severe symptoms and signs of DED. Enrolled from 27 ophthalmology and optometry centers, both academic and private, in 17 US states, 535 patients were followed up for 1 year. Participants screened positive for depression if they scored 42 or less on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Symptoms of DED were assessed by Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Brief Ocular Discomfort Index (BODI) and signs assessed by tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, corneal and conjunctival staining, tear osmolarity, and meibomian gland dysfunction at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. A composite severity sign score was calculated from all 6 signs. Inflammatory markers (cytokines in tears and HLA-DR expression by conjunctival surface cells) were measured for some trial participants. Features of DED were compared between participants with and without depression and adjusted for age, sex, race, visits, and baseline comorbidities. Among the 535 participants, mean (SD) age was 58 (13.2) years, 434 participants (81%) were women, and 398 (74.4%) were White. Participants who screened positive for depression had worse DED symptoms by OSDI (effect size\u2009=\u20090.45, P\u2009<\u2009.001) and BODI (effect size\u2009=\u20090.46, P\u2009<\u2009.001) and composite DED sign score (effect size\u2009=\u20090.21, P\u2009=\u2009.006). Lower MCS score (ie, worse depression) was correlated with higher OSDI score (ie, worse DED symptoms) at baseline (Spearman \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.09, P\u2009=\u2009.03), 6 months (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.20, P\u2009<\u2009.001), and 12 months (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.21, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Inflammatory markers did not differ by depression status. Depression was associated with more severe dry eye symptoms and overall signs, suggesting that among patients with moderate to severe DED, those with depression may be likely to have more severe DED.

Corneal topography demonstrated an area of steepened corneal surface inferiorly, and corneal thickness was relatively thicker in this area than in others. At 5 months, the corneal findings were normal by slitlamp biomicroscopy but corneal topography results remained unchanged. Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography examination showed remnant intrastromal lenticule tissue in this affected area. To our knowledge, this is the first case of residue intrastromal lenticule after refractive lenticule extraction.

Descriptive and simulation study. Twelve thousand one hundred fifty eyes from 7392 adult patients with glaucoma or glaucoma-suspect status followed up at the Wilmer Eye Institute from 2013 through 2021. All eyes had at least 5 measurements of RNFL thickness on the Cirrus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec) with signal strength of 6 or more. Rates of RNFL worsening for average RNFL thickness and for the 4 quadrants were measured using linear regression. Simulations were used to estimate the accuracy of detecting worsening-defined as the percentage of patients in whom the true rate of RNFL worsening was at or less than different criterion rates of worsening when the OCT-measured rate was also at or less than these criterion rates-for two different measurement strategies: evenly spaced (equal time intervals between measurements) and clustered (approximately half the measurements at each end point of the period). The 75th percentile (moderate) and 90th percentile (rapid) rates of RNFL worsening for average RNFL thickness and the accuracy of diagnosing worsening at these moderate and rapid rates. The 75th and 90th percentile rates of worsening for average RNFL thickness were -1.09 \u03bcm/year and -2.35 \u03bcm/year, respectively. Simulations showed that, for the average measurement frequency in our sample of approximately 3 OCT scans over a 2-year period, moderate and rapid RNFL worsening were diagnosed accurately only 47% and 40% of the time, respectively. Estimates for the number of OCT scans needed to achieve a range of accuracy levels are provided. For example, 60% accuracy requires 7 measurements to detect both moderate and rapid worsening within a 2-year period if the more efficient clustered measurement strategy is used.

Furthermore, refractive lenticules can be prepared within the stroma and removed in a single-step operation. In 10 rabbits, cuts were made to create both a lamellar flap and an intrastromal refractive lenticule. The flap was lifted, the lenticule was extracted and, finally, the flap was repositioned (intrastromal laser keratomileusis, ILK).

The wound healing was restricted to the flap-stroma interface, most pronounced at the periphery of the flaps.

Because gangliosides play an important role in neuronal cell differentiation and proliferation, this change in ganglioside profile may indicate retinal maturation. Dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs) such as 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 improve visual acuity in infants. Dietary LCPs stimulate neonatal retinal development by altering membrane phospholipids, which in turn affect cell signaling pathways. It is unknown whether dietary ganglioside and LCPs affect the metabolism of phospholipids and gangliosides during retinal development. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (18 days old) were fed semipurified diets consisting of 20% fat (control diet) for 2 weeks containing either 0.1% ganglioside enriched in GD3 (GG diet) or 1% 20:4n-6 and 0.5% 22:6n-3 (LCP diet) in the control diet. The profile of ganglioside and phospholipid was measured. The GG diet increased the ganglioside content by 39% in the retina, with a relative increase in GD3 (by 13%). Dietary LCPs significantly increased the relative levels of GD3 (by 19%, P < 0.01). Total phospholipid was decreased by the LCP-supplemented diet (by 28%). Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine increased with concomitant decreases in phosphatidylinositol and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine when animals were fed either the LCP or the GG diet. Animals fed dietary ganglioside increased in total retinal ganglioside and GD3 content during retinal development, with a concomitant alteration of phospholipid metabolism. Feeding animals dietary LCPs also affected ganglioside metabolism in the developing retina, suggesting a new mechanism by which these dietary lipids may promote maturation of photoreceptor cells.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aeaafb2-3226-46e4-a1c4-4048a9dfa25e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aeaafb2-3226-46e4-a1c4-4048a9dfa25e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Improving the second-eye refractive error in patients undergoing bilateral sequential cataract surgery.", "year": "2012", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2012.01.008", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Jivrajka RV", "Shammas MC", "Shammas HJ"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a588509a-2299-49d5-8589-225f383047a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Improving the second-eye refractive error in patients undergoing bilateral sequential cataract surgery.", "year": "2012", "doi": "10.1016/j.ophtha.2012.01.008", "journal": "Ophthalmology", "authors": ["Jivrajka RV", "Shammas MC", "Shammas HJ"]}, "hash": "0038e3809474a1a257b5b812a1d668a88c3ec8e640f5fbf875872cc1f437c697", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e00961fc-96f8-4e9d-9770-47e0fc1ffe42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Dietary ganglioside and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids increase ganglioside GD3 content and alter the phospholipid profile in neonatal rat retina.", "year": "2005", "doi": "10.1167/iovs.04-1439", "journal": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "authors": ["Park EJ", "Suh M", "Clandinin MT"]}, "hash": "3c1877a569f92b228b70751d32584d4ed167760ff76a12ea7ead551d7d6f8c63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db54dec5-b070-4bd4-a5af-9e344ca45b5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4408492224621caa4e5a4b2c717a205cad0d475e5357980e301c7178a8c2598d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To assess the refractive error in the second eye to undergo surgery when the intraocular lens (IOL) power was modified to correct 50% of the error from the first eye when such an error exceeded 0.50 diopter (D).

Two patients underwent iris tumour biopsy at an ocular oncology service. A trabeculectomy punch (Kelly Descemet's membrane punch) with a 1.0 mm diameter head and a 0.75 mm deep bite was inserted through a clear cornea perforated by a SatinSlit 3.2 mm angled slit knife into a viscoelastic-filled anterior chamber. The Kelly punch was placed over the lesion and pressed down before the punch was made. After obtaining the sample, the Kelly punch was removed from the eye and then opened over a dry cellulose sponge. Tissue samples were placed in 4% formalin and processed routinely for standard staining with H&E, periodic acid Schiff and immunostains. In both patients, by using the punch biopsy technique with the Kelly punch, we were able to obtain a 0.8 x 0.6 mm piece of tissue, large enough for any histological analysis. H&E staining showed spindle cell melanoma. Tissue sections, stained positive with MART-1 (melanoma antigen recognised by T cells) and negative with cytokeratin, established the diagnosis of melanoma of the iris in each of these patients.

In-person clinical monitoring places a significant burden on patients, caregivers and healthcare systems and is limited in that it only provides clinicians with a snapshot of the patient's disease status. The advent of remote monitoring technologies offers the potential for patients to test their own retinal health at home in collaboration with clinicians, reducing the need for in-clinic appointments. In this review we discuss visual function tests, both existing and novel, that have the potential for remote use and consider their suitability for discriminating the presence of disease and progression of disease. We then review the clinical evidence supporting the use of mobile applications for monitoring of visual function from clinical development through to validation studies and real-world implementation. This review identified seven app-based visual function tests: four that have already received some form of regulatory clearance and three under development. The evidence included in this review shows that remote monitoring offers great potential for patients with macular pathology to monitor their condition from home, reducing the need for burdensome clinic visits and expanding clinicians' understanding of patients' retinal health beyond traditional clinical monitoring.

The therapeutic effect was studied in a keratitis model induced in rabbits by intrastromal injections of 10(3) S. aureus cells of three different methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains and one methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (MSSA).

Histopathological analysis was performed on MSSA-infected rabbits, killed at either one or 84\u00a0h after completion of treatment and on uninfected eyes 1\u00a0h after treatment termination. The number of bacteria in the staphylolysin-treated corneas was significantly reduced in all infections with the four S. aureus strains studied as compared to controls: the staphylolysin-treated eyes infected with MRSA strains were either completely sterilized or showed a 3-4 orders of magnitude decrease in the number of cfu/cornea (p\u2009=\u20090.004 to 0.005); all of the staphylolysin-treated MSSA-infected eyes were sterile. Histopathological analysis of the methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) strain-infected eyes at 84\u00a0h after completion of treatment showed moderate inflammation in the staphylolysin-treated eyes as compared with extensive abscess formation in the control group.

Serial section transmission electron microscopy was utilized to reconstruct BC and HC neurites in macaque monkey and mouse, including metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6)-knockout mice. Starting from sporadically distributed branching points, rod BC and HC neurites (B and H, respectively) took specific paths to rod spherules by gradually adjusting their mutual positions, which resulted in a closed alternating pattern of H\u2012B\u2012H\u2012B neurites at the rod spherule aperture. This order corresponded to the array of elements constituting the postsynaptic complex of ribbon synapses. We identified novel helical coils of HC processes surrounding the rod BC dendrite in both mouse and macaque retinas, and these structures occurred more frequently in mGluR6-knockout than wild-type mouse retinas. Horizontal cell processes also formed hook-like protrusions that encircled cone BC and HC neurites below the cone pedicles in the macaque retina. Bipolar and horizontal cell neurites take specific paths to adjust their mutual positions at the rod spherule aperture.

A single-centre, prospective, open-label study of 11 patients with documented CNV progression after PDT treatment who underwent combined PDT and intravitreal injection of 1.5 mg of bevacizumab was undertaken. Standardized ophthalmic evaluation was performed at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 12 and 24. Clinical evidence of complications and changes in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts and in fluorescein leakage from CNV were evaluated. The mean (+/-SD) age of the 11 patients was 74 (+/-5) years. Seven eyes had been treated with one previous PDT session and four eyes had two previous PDT sessions. The mean baseline logMAR ETDRS BCVA was 1.031 (Snellen equivalent, 20/200(-2)).

Surgical factors recorded included incision length, surgery duration, and the surgeon performing the operation. Participants were followed up for 6 weeks after surgery and evaluated for eyelid closure defect and trichiasis recurrence; in addition, in two thirds of the patients, eyelid contour abnormality and granuloma formation were evaluated. First-time trichiasis surgery was performed on 2615 eyelids. Of these, 2601 eyelids without surgical failure were followed up 6 weeks after surgery. Of the eyelids treated, 2.3% had recurrent trichiasis and 1.3% had an eyelid closure defect. Data on eyelid contour abnormalities and granuloma formation were recorded for 1881 eyes, with rates of 1.2% and 10.5%, respectively. Associated risk factors differed by outcome. Surgeon was predictive of eyelid closure defect and granuloma formation. Eyelids with short incisions were nearly four times more likely to have recurrent trichiasis (95% confidence interval, 1.7-9.3). Baseline trichiasis severity was predictive of eyelid contour abnormalities and recurrent trichiasis. Epilation was associated with granuloma formation, but was protective against eyelid closure defect. Surgical factors are important predictors of unfavorable outcomes in the weeks immediately after surgery. Although the overall rate of serious uncorrectable unfavorable outcomes was very low, the high rate of granuloma formation, which can be treated by removal, highlights the need for follow-up of patients after trichiasis surgery.

In this study, we determined anterior and posterior corneal HOAs over a range of severity of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Cross-sectional study. A total of 108 eyes (62 subjects) with a range of severity of FECD and 71 normal eyes (38 subjects). All corneas were examined by using slit-lamp biomicroscopy to determine the severity of FECD versus normality. Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy corneas were categorized as mild, moderate, or advanced according to the area and confluence of guttae and the presence of clinically visible edema. Normal corneas were devoid of any guttae. Wavefront errors from the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces were derived from Scheimpflug images and expressed as Zernike polynomials through the sixth order over a 6-mm diameter optical zone. Backscatter from the anterior 120 \u03bcm and posterior 60 \u03bcm of the cornea also was measured from Scheimpflug images and was standardized to a fixed scatter source. Variables were compared between FECD and control eyes by using generalized estimating equation models to adjust for age and correlation between fellow eyes. High-order aberrations, expressed as root mean square of wavefront errors, and backscatter of the anterior and posterior cornea. Total anterior corneal HOAs were increased in moderate (0.61\u00b10.27 \u03bcm, mean \u00b1 standard deviation; P = 0.01) and advanced (0.66\u00b10.28 \u03bcm; P = 0.01) FECD compared with controls (0.47\u00b10.16 \u03bcm). Total posterior corneal HOAs were increased in mild (0.22\u00b10.09 \u03bcm; P = 0.017), moderate (0.22\u00b10.08 \u03bcm; P < 0.001), and advanced (0.23\u00b10.09 \u03bcm; P < 0.001) FECD compared with controls (0.16\u00b10.03 \u03bcm). Anterior and posterior corneal backscatter were higher for all severities of FECD compared with controls (P \u2264 0.02, anterior; P \u2264 0.001, posterior).

Fresh RPE-choroid specimens from bovine eyes were placed in diffusion chambers for permeability experiments with carboxyfluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextrans with molecular masses from 4 to 80 kDa, and beta-blockers exhibiting a wide range of lipophilicity (atenolol, nadolol, pindolol, timolol, metoprolol, and betaxolol). Permeability experiments were performed both in the choroid-to-retina (inward) direction and in the retina-to-choroid (outward) direction. Carboxyfluorescein and FITC-dextrans were determined by fluorometry, and beta-blockers by HPLC. The transepithelial electrical resistance and potential difference were monitored during the experiments. Permeability of the fluorescent FITC-dextran probes through RPE-choroid decreased significantly with the increasing size of the probe. RPE-choroid was 35 times more permeable to carboxyfluorescein (376 Da) than to FITC-dextran 80 kDa. The permeabilities of lipophilic beta-blockers were up to 8 and 20 times higher than that of hydrophilic atenolol and carboxyfluorescein, respectively. The lag time of solute flux across the RPE-choroid increased with the molecular weight and lipophilicity. Compared with published data on isolated sclera, bovine RPE-choroid was 10 to 100 times less permeable to hydrophilic compounds and macromolecules. The permeability of lipophilic molecules in RPE-choroid was in the same range as in the sclera. RPE is a major barrier and may be the rate-limiting factor in the retinal delivery of hydrophilic drugs and macromolecules through the transscleral route.

The study was designed as a prospective trial. The cohort consisted of 29 diabetic patients with scheduled vitreous procedures (intravitreal injection or pars plana vitrectomy). The control group included 30 patients scheduled for macular surgery (macular hole or epiretinal membrane). Nine patients (four from the diabetic maculopathy [DM] group and five from the control group) were excluded from the study because of unsuccessful vitreous samples. Retinal oximetry was performed several hours before the vitreous procedure was performed, and vitreous samples were obtained during the procedure. The concentrations of VEGF, Serpin F1/pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and placental growth factor (PlGF) were measured by ELISA. A negative correlation between level of VEGF and arteriovenous (AV) saturation difference was determined in the DM group (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.607; two-tailed test, P = 0.002). Also a negative correlation between level of PlGF and AV saturation difference was determined in the DM group (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.521; two-tailed test, P = 0.011) A positive correlation between PlGF level and the vein saturation was not statistically significant (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.325; two-tailed test, P = 0.130).
